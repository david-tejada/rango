## [0.3.0](https://github.com/david-tejada/rango/releases/tag/v0.3.0) - 2023-01-27

### Changed

- Complete rewrite of the hint rendering logic to implement **static hints** so
  that the hints always stay with their target element, even when scrolling.
- Include a 1000px viewport margin where the hints are rendered. Serving for a
  nicer scrolling experience.
- Implement fade-in transition effect for the hints when first rendered for a
  smoother experience.
- Render hints using shadow DOM which provides better encapsulation and avoids
  some issues like in #20.
- Improve the positioning of the hints so that more elements are accessible.
- Simplify the logic for detecting what is a hintable element. This improves
  performance and reduces duplicates. A tradeoff is that now, if the element is
  not minimally accessible, it won't display a hint (see custom hints for a
  solution to this).
- Improve page scroll commands so that if the page doesn't scroll it uses the
  scroll container at the center.
- Add `pointer-events: none` to the hint style to prevent it from swallowing
  clicks when using a mouse.
- Include source maps also in production.
- Make the default hotkey `ctrl-shift-insert` for all the browsers except for
  Safari.
- The command `copy text <user.rango_target>` will now also copy the content of
  an input field.
- Disconnect all observers when the hints are off to avoid unnecessary load.
- Batch measuring and writing to the DOM to minimize reflow and avoid potential
  performance issues.

### Added

- Implement custom hints: include mechanism to display more hints when the
  target element doesn't display one. New commands:
  - `hint extra`: Display hints for more elements.
  - `hint more`: Display hints for previously excluded elements.
  - `hint less`: Only display the default hints.
  - `include <user.rango_target>`: Mark the selected hints for inclusion.
  - `exclude <user.rango_target>`: Mark the selected hints for exclusion.
  - `some more`: Mark more hints for inclusion/exclusion.
  - `some less`: Mark less hints for inclusion/exclusion.
  - `custom hints save`: Save the currently selected hints marked for
    inclusion/exclusion so that they render by default.
  - `custom hints reset`: Remove any previously included/excluded custom hints.
- Implement new commands `page next` and `page last` to navigate to the next or
  previous page in paginated sites.
- Implement new command `go root` to navigate to the root of the page.
- Implement new scroll commands:
  - `upper/downer <number>`: Scroll up/down a certain amount of pages.
  - `upper/downer all`: Scroll to the top.
  - `scroll left/right`: Scroll to the left/right.
  - `scroll left/right all`: Scroll all the way to the left/right.
  - `tiny left/right`: Scroll to the left/right a small amount.
  - `upper/downer left/right`: Scroll the left/right aside upwards/downwards.
  - `upper/downer left/right all`: Scroll the left/right aside to the
    top/bottom.
  - `scroll left/right <user.rango_target>`: Scroll the container with the
    hinted element to the left/right.
  - `tiny left/right <user.rango_target>`: Scroll the container with the hinted
    element a small amount to the left/right.
  - `left/right again`: Repeat the previous scroll to the left/right.
- New command `paste to <user.rango_target>` to paste the contents of the
  clipboard to an input field.
- New commands `pre <user.rango_target>` and `post <user.rango_target>` to focus
  an input field and please the caret a the start or the end.
- New command `change <user.rango_target>` to focus an input field and remove
  its contents.
- New commands `insert <user.text> to <user.rango_target>` and
  `enter <user.text> to <user.rango_target>` to enter text to a text field. The
  latter also presses enter.

### Fixed

- Improve the events dispatched to fix some elements not reacting to Rango
  clicks.
- Dynamically retrieve the pointer target so that we click the same element that
  we would if we used the mouse. Fixing some issues of the wrong element being
  clicked.
- Fix regression of commands `up again` and `down again` not working.
- Reimplement the actions `browser.go_back` and `browser.go_forward` in the
  context of Rango to improve their reliability and fix their behavior in
  Chromium browsers due to the history entry being marked as skippable when
  there's no user intervention.
- Fix multiple URLs being added to the end of the document title when the URL
  changes but the title doesn't.
- Fix clicking on `<select>` elements so that it directly opens the menu of
  options.
