				<h2>What's new?</h2>
				<p>
					Hello! I hope you are doing well. Here I bring you a new Rango update
					to make your web browsing life a bit easier. I hope you appreciate it.
					This release brings us the ability to target elements by their text
					content using fuzzy search. This functionality can also be used for
					scripting. We now also have the ability to edit custom selectors from
					the settings page. Besides that this release brings more improvements
					and bug fixes.

					There is still a lot of work to do, features to add and bugs to fix. I
					would like to be able to continue working on Rango to bring you all
					those goodies. To be able to do that I need your support. If Rango
					makes your life easier when navigating the web and has become an
					essential tool for you, please consider becoming a sponsor. You just
