				Release notes for Rango
				<span id="version">v0.8.0</span>
			</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
					This release brings major performance improvements, better error
					handling, range targets, improvements to fuzzy search functionality,
					new mouse-based commands and a lot more.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Update <em>rango-talon</em></h2>
				<p>
					You need to update <em>rango-talon</em> to be able to use the new
					commands. Note that this update changes how actions are called in
					<em>rango-talon</em>, now using specific actions instead of "stringy"
					ones (for example,
					<code>user.rango_click_element(rango_target)</code> instead of
					<code
						>user.rango_command_with_target("clickElement", rango_target)</code
					>). If you have defined your own commands outside of rango-talon, you
					should update them to use the new actions. The old ones will still
					work but will be deprecated in the future.
				</p>

				<h2>Your support is appreciated</h2>
				<p>
					I have spent a lot of time on this update. I want Rango to feel and
					work as good as possible. I am very appreciative of all the support I
					get. Especially of those who have been supporting me for a long time.
					But the thing is that, after a certain point, the more I work on
					Rango, the better it becomes, and the more users it has, the less
					money from sponsors I get. Probably from those who remember how it was
					to navigate the web by voice before Rango.
				</p>
				<p>
					Think of how many extensions you know with a single developer that are
					published to four different extension stores. Including Safari, for
					which I have to pay the Apple Developer Program, costing me almost an
					entire month of my sponsor money. It is a considerable effort. I
					understand that people who rely on assistive technology aren't always
					in the best financial situation. I am on that same boat too. For this
					reason I ask you that, if you can afford it, you consider sponsoring
					me. All you have to do is click this big button below or use the
					command
					<kbd>rango open sponsor</kbd>.

						match isn't found.

							rango_target)</code
						>.
					</li>
