			<h1>Rango has been updated to version 0.4.2</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>What's new?</h2>
				<p>
					Hello, my dear friends! I have been hard at work to bring you all a
					couple of highly requested features:
					<strong>settings page</strong> and <strong>notifications</strong>.
					With the setting page you can now change things like the font used for
					the hints, the opacity, whether to use lower or upper case and more.
					You can open the setting page with the command
					<code>rango settings</code>. Toast notifications give you much needed
					feedback when using commands like <code>copy page address</code> or
					when toggling the hints.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Update rango-talon</h2>
				<p>
					You need to update rango-talon to be able to use the new commands.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Become a sponsor</h2>
				<p>
					There is still a lot of work to do, features to add and bugs to fix. I
					would like to be able to continue working on Rango full time to bring
					you all those goodies. To be able to do that I need your support. If
					Rango makes your life easier when navigating the web and has become an
					essential tool for you, please consider becoming a sponsor. You just
					have to click this big button below or use the command
					<code>rango open sponsor</code>.
