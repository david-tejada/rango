				<h2>What's new?</h2>
				<p>
					Hello, my dear friends! Here I am again with some more good stuff to
					make your web browsing life a bit easier. I hope you appreciate it.
					This release brings us <strong>references</strong>. References allow
					us to mark hints/elements to be able to use them in talon scripts. It
					also brings us the ability to save and scroll to custom position.
					Besides that this release brings more improvements and bug fixes.
				</p>

				<p>Here is a video highlighting what's new in this update:</p>

				<h2>Update rango-talon</h2>
				<p>
					You need to update rango-talon to be able to use the new commands.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Important</strong>: I have made significant changes to
					rango-talon. If you have made modifications outside of
					<em>rango.talon</em> you might encounter merge conflicts. If you have
					any issue reach out to me in the Talon Slack channel. Be aware that now tags
					are used instead of settings to customize certain aspects. Here are
					the tags you need to be aware of:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>user.rango_direct_clicking</code>: Enabled by default. Remove
						it if you want to use explicit clicking.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>user.rango_exclude_singles</code>: Disabled by default. Add it
						if you have disabled <code>Include single letter hints</code> in the
						extension.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>user.rango_number_hints</code>: Disabled by default. Add it if
						you have enabled <code>Use number for hints</code> in the extension.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Become a sponsor</h2>
				<p>
					There is still a lot of work to do, features to add and bugs to fix. I
					would like to be able to continue working on Rango to bring you all
					those goodies. To be able to do that I need your support. If Rango
					makes your life easier when navigating the web and has become an
					essential tool for you, please consider becoming a sponsor. You just
					have to click this big button below or use the command
					<code>rango open sponsor</code>.
