			<h1>Rango was installed!</h1>
			<p>
				Rango is a cross browser extension that helps you interact with your
				browser using your voice and
				<a href="https://talonvoice.com/">Talon</a>. It can also be used as a
				standalone extension to click elements using your keyboard. It works by
				drawing hints with letters next to elements that you can use to click,
				hover, copy or show link addresses. It also helps you scroll, open
				multiple links in new tabs, close multiple tabs and more.
			</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Use With Keyboard</h2>
				<p>
					In order to use Rango with your keyboard you need to first activate
					<strong>Keyboard Clicking</strong>. You can do this by pressing the
					designated shortcut <code>ctrl-shift-5</code> or by right clicking on
					the extension button on the toolbar and then clicking on the
					<strong>Keyboard Clicking</strong> menu.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once activated, to click an element you just need to type the
					corresponding hint letters.
				</p>

				<h2>Use With Talon</h2>
				<p>
					In order to use Rango with Talon you need to add
					<a href="https://github.com/david-tejada/rango-talon">rango-talon</a>
					to your Talon user folder. Clone or download the rango-talon files to
					your Talon user folder.
				</p>
				<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
				<p>
					To click on elements you just have to say the word
					<code>click</code> followed by the letters of the hint. You can also
					omit the word <code>click</code> using
					<strong>Direct Clicking</strong>. By default
					<strong>Direct Clicking</strong> is active. You can deactivate it with
					the command <code>rango explicit</code>. With
					<strong>Explicit Clicking</strong> you have to precede every hint with
					the word <code>click</code>. This mode prevents any misclicks at the
					expense of being a bit more verbose.
