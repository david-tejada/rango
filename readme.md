The cross browser extension
that helps you control your browser by voice.<br>ðŸ¦Ž It blends in! </p>

## Introduction

Rango is a cross browser extension that helps you interact with web pages using
your voice and [talon](https://talonvoice.com/). It does this by drawing hints
with letters next to elements that you can use to click, hover, copy or show
link adresses. It also helps you scroll, open multiple links in new tabs, close
multiple tabs and more.

## Sponsorship

Rango is mostly the work of one developer. I have spent hundreds of hours making
sure Rango works and feels great. I would like to be able to continue working on
Rango to make it even better. To be able to do that I need your support. If
Rango makes your life easier when navigating the web or it has become an
essential tool for you, please consider becoming a sponsor.
[Click here](https://github.com/sponsors/david-tejada) or just say <kbd>rango
open sponsor</kbd>.

## Support

If you have any question or need help, you can reach out in the channel
**#ext-rango** of the [Talon Slack](https://talonvoice.com/chat).

## Installation

In order to use the extension you need two pieces: the extension and the talon
files.

- The extension can be installed from the respective store:
  [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rango/),
  [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rango/lnemjdnjjofijemhdogofbpcedhgcpmb),
  [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/rango/pcngjebdhphedjkfhipblkgjbjoeaaeb),
  [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/rango-for-safari/id6461166435?l=en-GB&mt=12).

- (Safari only) In order for Rango to work in Safari you need to first enable it
  in the Safari preferences. Go to Preferences -> Extensions and check Rango on
  the left sidebar. Then you need to click the extension icon in Safari and
  select "Always Allow on Every Website".

- The talon files can be found in the
  [rango-talon](https://github.com/david-tejada/rango-talon) repository. Clone
  or download them to your talon user folder. **IMPORTANT**: Make sure to clone
  or download the rango-talon repository and not this one.

It is also assumed that you have installed
[talonhub/community](https://github.com/talonhub/community) to your talon user
folder. If not you need at least to have the following captures defined:
`<user.letter>`, `<user.word>`, `<user.number_small>`, `<user.number_string>`
(only if you want to use number hints) and the list `{user.website}`.

### IMPORTANT: Disabling Rango on Some Browsers

Once **rango-talon** has been added to your talon user folder, Rango will be
active for all your browsers. If you haven't installed the extension itself in a
specific browser, it's better to disable Rango for that browser to avoid
unexpected behavior. The best way to do this is to activate the tag
`user.rango_disabled` for that browser. For example, if you want to disable
Rango in Brave and Chrome, you could have a _.talon_ file with the following
contents anywhere in your talon user folder.

```talon
app: brave
app: chrome
-
tag(): user.rango_disabled
```

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Don't Work

If the hints are displayed but the commands don't work, most of the time it has
to do with the configuration of the hotkey. In order to communicate with Rango,
Talon presses a key combination to prompt Rango to read the command present on
the clipboard. By default the key combination is <kbd>ctrl-shift-insert</kbd> in
all the browsers except for Safari, where it is <kbd>ctrl-shift-3</kbd>. If
Rango commands aren't working for you, make sure that the hotkey is properly set
up. The shortcut that needs to be changed is `Get the talon request`.

#### Where to Find the Extension Keyboard Shortcuts

In Firefox, navigate to [about:addons](about:addons), click on the cog at the
top right and then "Manage Extension Shortcuts".

In Chrome, navigate to
[chrome://extensions/shortcuts](chrome://extensions/shortcuts).

In Edge, navigate to [edge://extensions/shortcuts](edge://extensions/shortcuts).

### No Hints Viewing Local Files

In order for Rango to work within local files like
`file:///Users/david/Code/my-page/index.html` when using a Chromium browser you
will have to enable it. Navigate to the extension details and enable the setting
`Allow access to file URLs`.

In Firefox access to file URLs is always enabled.

Unfortunately, Safari doesn't allow extensions to access file URLs at all, so
this feature won't be available in this browser.

## Settings

There are several settings you can adjust to change the appearance of the hints
and the overall behavior of the extension. To open the settings page you just
need to use the command <kbd>rango settings</kbd>. You can also open them by
right clicking the extension icon and clicking the menu item `Settings`.

## Usage

**Note**: The notation <kbd>&lt;target&gt;</kbd> in this readme can refer to a
single or multiple hints chained with the word <kbd>and</kbd> (or the word
<kbd>plus</kbd> if you use number hints). For example, the command <kbd>click
any and bat</kbd> would click on the elements marked with the hints `a` and `b`.
Most Rango commands accept multiple hints as target.

### Hints

Hints are marks with letters (or numbers if you toggle the setting
`Use number for hints`) that appear next to elements and that we can use to
refer to the element to click, hover, copy its text content, etc.

<p align="left">
  <img src="images/screenshot-hint.png" height=60px">
</p>

If you want to know how to use number for hints, which elements receive hints
and what to do if an element you want to click doesn't have a hint, take a look
at the section [More on hints](#more-on-hints).

### Click

There are two modes: direct and explicit clicking. By default direct mode is
enabled. To use explicit clicking you need to delete the tag
`user.rango_direct_clicking` in _rango.talon_.

#### Direct Clicking

This is the default mode. With it enabled you just have to say the characters
displayed on the hint to click an element. To avoid misclicks it only listens to
a pause, one or two letters, followed by another pause. If there is no hint with
those letters it will type them. If you actually want to enter one or two
characters the are part of a hint you have to use the _talonhub/community_
command <kbd>press</kbd>.

##### Examples

Assuming default talon letters:

- <kbd>air</kbd>: Clicks on the element with the hint `a`.
- <kbd>gust harp</kbd>: Clicks on the element with the hint `gh`.
- <kbd>air bat cap</kbd>: Enters the characters `abc`.
- <kbd>press air</kbd>: Enters the character `a`.

#### Explicit Clicking

With explicit clicking you have to precede every hint with the word
<kbd>click</kbd>. This mode prevents any misclicks at the expense of being a bit
more tedious.

#### Keyboard Clicking

Apart from using your voice for clicking you can also use your keyboard for
that.

To toggle it you have to use the command <kbd>keyboard toggle</kbd> or press
<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>5</kbd> in Firefox. In Chrome and Edge you
have to set the shortcut manually since there is a limit of four shortcuts we
can set by default. You'll see the toolbar icon shows a little orange dot when
keyboard clicking is on. To allow typing text in pages, keyboard clicking will
be off whenever the element in focus accepts text input.

##### Excluding Keys

When using keyboard clicking you might want to have the ability to use certain
keys as shortcuts for specific websites. For example, you might want to be able
to use the key <kbd>c</kbd> in YouTube to toggle captions. The easy way to do
this is to right click on the extension icon and select the menu
`Add Keys to Exclude`. This will add an entry to the keys to exclude setting
with the URL pattern for the current URL and will open the settings so you can
easily add the keys you want to exclude.

### Focus

- <kbd>focus &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Focus the target element.

#### Focus and Enter

Clicking with Rango might fail on some elements. For example, clicking on
elements that copy things to the clipboard almost always fails because the
browser thinks there was no user interaction and disallows it. To avoid this
pitfall you might use the following command.

- <kbd>flick &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Focus an element and then press enter with
  talon.

### Open in a New Tab

- <kbd>blank &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Opens the link in a new tab. If you use
  multiple targets all the links will open in new tabs and the first one will
  receive focus.
- <kbd>stash &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Opens the link in a new tab without focusing
  that tab. When using direct clicking and multiple targets you can omit the
  word "stash". For example, <kbd>air bat and air drum</kbd> will open the links
  with the hints "ah" and "ad" in a new tab without stealing focus from the
  current one.

### Navigation

- <kbd>go root</kbd>: Navigate to the root of the current page.
- <kbd>page next</kbd>: Navigate to the next page in paginated pages.
- <kbd>page last</kbd>: Navigate to the previous page in paginated pages.

### Input Fields

**Note**: "Input field" here refers to any element with editable content. It
doesn't need to be an `<input>` element.

- <kbd>paste to &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Paste the contents of the clipboard to an
  input field.
- <kbd>insert &lt;text&gt; to &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Inserts text to an input
  field. It first clicks the element so it will work in places were you first
  have to click a button that opens the field, like a search button.
- <kbd>enter &lt;text&gt; to &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Same as the previous command
  but it also presses the enter key at the end to submit.
- <kbd>change &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Focus an input field and remove its
  contents.
- <kbd>pre &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Places the cursor at the start of an input
  field.
- <kbd>post &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Places the cursor at the end of an input
  field.

### Copy to the Clipboard

- <kbd>copy &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: If the element is a link it copies the url to
  the clipboard.
- <kbd>copy mark &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: If the element is a link it copies the
  link in markdown format to the clipboard.
- <kbd>copy text &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Copies the text content of the element to
  the clipboard.

### Copy Current URL Information

- <kbd>copy page (address | host name | host | origin | path | port |
  protocol)</kbd>: Copies the information relative to the current URL to the
  clipboard.
- <kbd>copy mark address</kbd>: Copies the current URL in markdown format to the
  clipboard.

### Hover

- <kbd>hover &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Dispatches a hover event to the selected
  element. Sometimes this command doesn't have a visible result if the current
  page doesn't have a hover event handler for this element. One example of a
  page that does have hover event handlers for links is the Wikipedia, where
  you'll get a popup with a preview of the linked article.
- <kbd>dismiss</kbd>: Clears any previously hovered element. If there is a
  focused element it would also remove the focus from that element.

### Show Element Information

- <kbd>show &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Shows a tooltip with the element title and url
  if the element is a link.

### Scroll

The default behavior for scrolling in Rango is "smooth". The behavior will be
"instant" if you have configured your OS to prefer reduced motion. You can
follow the instructions
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/refers-reduced-motion#user_preferences)
if you want to know how to do that. You can also configure the preferred
scrolling behavior in the settings.

#### Page Scrolling

These commands scroll the page, that is, the html or body elements, or the
scroll container at the center of the page if those elements don't scroll.

- <kbd>upper/downer</kbd>: Scroll up/down.
- <kbd>upper/downer &lt;number&gt;</kbd>: Scroll up/down a certain amount of
  pages.
- <kbd>upper/downer all</kbd>: Scroll all the way to the top/bottom.
- <kbd>tiny up/down</kbd>: Scroll the page up/down a factor of 0.2.
- <kbd>scroll left/right</kbd>: Scroll to the left/right.
- <kbd>scroll left/right all</kbd>: Scroll all the way to the left/right.
- <kbd>tiny left/right</kbd>: Scroll to the left/right a factor of 0.2.

#### Aside Scrolling

You can easily scroll the left or right aside with these commands:

- <kbd>upper/downer left/right</kbd>: Scroll the left/right aside
  upwards/downwards.
- <kbd>upper/downer left/right all</kbd>: Scroll the left/right aside to the
  top/bottom.

#### Scrolling the Container That Includes a Hinted Element

Sometimes we want to scroll a container that is not the main page or an aside.
An example for that could be a popup with links. For that we need to refer to
one of the hints inside said container and use one of the following commands:

- <kbd>upper/downer &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Scroll up/down the container with the
  hinted element.
- <kbd>tiny up/down &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Scroll up/down the container with the
  hinted element a factor of 0.2.
- <kbd>scroll left/right &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Scroll the container with the
  hinted element to the left/right.
- <kbd>tiny left/right &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Scroll the container with the
  hinted element to the left/right a factor of 0.2.

#### Scrolling the Same Container Repeated Times

Once you have scrolled a container by referring to a hint inside it, you can
keep scrolling the same container with these commands without needing to refer
to a hint within it again. It will also use the same amount of scroll last used:

- <kbd>up/down/left/right again</kbd>: Scroll up/down/left/right the same factor
  a previously scrolled container.

#### Scrolling an Element to the Top, Bottom or Center

- <kbd>crown &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Scrolls the element with the hint to the top
  of the page/container. It tries to take into account any sticky/fixed headers
  and not scroll past that.
- <kbd>center &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Scrolls the element to the center of the
  page/container.
- <kbd>bottom &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Scrolls the element to the bottom of the
  page/container.

#### Custom Scroll Amounts

You can change the scroll amount of these commands or create new scroll commands
by adding/changing the last argument in the action call in your rango.talon
file. For example, the next commands would scroll up or down half of its scroll
container:

```talon
half up: user.rango_command_without_target("scrollUpPage", 0.5)
half down: user.rango_command_without_target("scrollDownPage", 0.5)
half up <user.rango_target>:
  user.rango_command_with_target("scrollUpAtElement", rango_target, 0.5)
half down <user.rango_target>:
  user.rango_command_with_target("scrollDownAtElement", rango_target, 0.5)
```

#### Save Scroll Positions

You can save scroll positions within a webpage to later be able to scroll to
that saved position.

- <kbd>scroll save &lt;word&gt;</kbd>: Store the current scroll position and
  assign it to the specified word.
- <kbd>scroll to &lt;word&gt;</kbd>: Scroll to the saved position. This uses
  fuzzy search, so a command like <kbd>scroll to object</kbd> will also match
  the saved scroll position `objects` if no scroll position `object` was stored.

### Tabs

- <kbd>tab clone</kbd>: Duplicates the current tab.
- <kbd>tab back</kbd>: Switches to the previously focused tab.
- <kbd>tab split</kbd>: Move the current tab to a new window.
- <kbd>tab hunt &lt;text&gt;</kbd>: Focuses the tab that matches the text in its
  URL or title. It uses fuzzy search and focuses the tab that better matches the
  text.
- <kbd>tab ahead</kbd>: If there are multiple results after using <kbd>tab
  hunt</kbd>, it focuses the next tab (by match score).
- <kbd>tab behind</kbd>: If there are multiple results after using <kbd>tab
  hunt</kbd>, it focuses the previous tab (by match score).
- <kbd>visit {user.website}</kbd>: This uses the websites defined in
  _websites.csv_ within _talonhub/community_. It will focus the first tab
  matching the website or open it in a new tab if there's no match.

#### Close Tabs

- <kbd>tab close other</kbd>: Closes all the tabs in the window except the
  current one.
- <kbd>tab close left</kbd>: Closes all the tabs in the window to the left of
  the current one.
- <kbd>tab close right</kbd>: Closes all the tabs in the window to the right of
  the current one.
- <kbd>tab close first [&lt;number&gt;]</kbd>: Closes the amount of tabs
  specified (or one if no number is given) starting from the leftmost tab.
- <kbd>tab close final [&lt;number&gt;]</kbd>: Closes the amount of tabs
  specified (or one if no number is given) starting from the rightmost tab.
- <kbd>tab close previous [&lt;number&gt;]</kbd>: Closes the amount of tabs
  specified (or one if no number is given) to the left of the current tab.
- <kbd>tab close next [&lt;number&gt;]</kbd>: Closes the amount of tabs
  specified (or one if no number is given) to the right of the current tab.

#### Focus Tabs Using Tab Markers

If you have the setting `Include tab markers in title` enabled (default) you can
refer to those markers to quickly focus a specific tab.

- <kbd>(go tab | slot) &lt;marker&gt;</kbd>: Focus the tab with the specified
  tab marker.
- <kbd>tab marker refresh</kbd>: Refreshes the tab markers for the existing
  tabs. Note that this command will refresh all unloaded tabs as otherwise we
  are unable to change the tab markers.

### Custom References

Custom references are a way to store references to hints and their underlying
element for later use either directly or in scripting. Once created references
will work even when the hints are off.

#### Save References

- <kbd>mark &lt;target&gt; as &lt;word&gt;</kbd>: Saves a reference to the
  element with the specified hint and assigns it to the specified word.
- <kbd>mark this as &lt;word&gt;</kbd>: Saves a reference to the focused element
  and assigns it to the specified word.
- <kbd>mark show</kbd>: Shows the visible saved references current in the page.
- <kbd>mark clear &lt;word&gt;</kbd>: Remove the reference corresponding to the
  specified word.

#### Use References Directly

- <kbd>click mark &lt;word&gt;</kbd>: Clicks the element with the assigned
  reference word.
- <kbd>focus mark &lt;word&gt;</kbd>: Focuses the element with the assigned
  reference word.
- <kbd>hover mark &lt;word&gt;</kbd>: Hovers the element with the assigned
  reference word.

#### Use References in Scripting

In order to use the saved references in scripting you need to use the talon
action `user.rango_run_action_on_reference`. This action accept two arguments:
the name of the action and the name of the reference.

Following is a simple example of a command that clicks the element with the
reference `edit`:

```talon
edit this: user.rango_run_action_on_reference("clickElement", "edit")
```

There are also a few talon helpers that will make easier to create commands that
use references. These will be active when editing `.talon` files.

- <kbd>click rango mark &lt;word&gt;</kbd>
- <kbd>focus rango mark &lt;word&gt;</kbd>
- <kbd>hover rango mark &lt;word&gt;</kbd>

### Fuzzy Search Elements

Similar to custom references you can also target elements by their text content
using fuzzy search. This can also be used for scripting purposes with the
advantage that there is no need to previously save a reference to the element.

#### Using Fuzzy Search Directly to Run Actions on Elements

- <kbd>follow &lt;text&gt;</kbd>: Click the element that better matches the
  provided text. It prioritizes elements within the viewport. Any element within
  the viewport will have priority over other elements outside of the viewport
  with better fuzziness score.
- <kbd>button &lt;text&gt;</kbd>: Click the element that better matches the
  provided text. It doesn't take into account if the element is within or
  outside the viewport. It will simply click the element in the document with
  the best fuzziness score.
- <kbd>focus text &lt;text&gt;</kbd>: Focus the element that better matches the
  provided text. It prioritizes elements within the viewport.
- <kbd>hover text &lt;text&gt;</kbd>: Hover the element that better matches the
  provided text. It prioritizes elements within the viewport.

#### Scripting Using Fuzzy Search

In order to use fuzzy search in scripting you need to use the talon action
`user.rango_run_action_on_text_matched_element`. This action accepts three
arguments: the name of the action, the text searched and whether to prioritize
elements within the viewport or not (optional, defaults to false).

Following is a simple example of a command that clicks the element that better
matches the text "edit" anywhere in the document.

```talon
edit this: user.rango_run_action_on_text_matched_element("clickElement", "edit", false)
```

There are also a few talon helpers that will make easier to create commands
using fuzzy search. These will be active when editing `.talon` files.

- <kbd>click rango text &lt;text&gt;</kbd>
- <kbd>focus rango text &lt;text&gt;</kbd>
- <kbd>hover rango text &lt;text&gt;</kbd>

### Modify Hints Size

- <kbd>hint bigger</kbd>: Increase the size of the hints.
- <kbd>hint smaller</kbd>: Decrease the size of the hints.

### Show and Hide the Hints

- <kbd>hints refresh</kbd>: Refreshes the hints without needing to reload the
  page.
- <kbd>hints toggle</kbd>: Toggles the hints on and off.
- <kbd>hints on/off [now | page | host | tab]</kbd>: Turns on/off the hints with
  an optional priority level.
  - <kbd>now</kbd>: This is the highest level of priority. The hints will be
    toggled on/off for the current page until the page is reloaded or the user
    navigates to another page.
  - <kbd>page</kbd>: The hints will always be on/off for the current page.
  - <kbd>host</kbd>: The hints will always be on/off for the current host.
  - <kbd>tab</kbd>: The hints will always be on/off for the current tab.
  - <kbd>global</kbd>: The hints will be on/off globally.
  - If we just say <kbd>hints on</kbd> the hints are toggled globally in all
    tabs and in all windows. This is the lowest level of priority, if any of the
    previous toggles are set they will take precedence over this one.
- <kbd>hints reset (page | host | tab | global | everywhere)</kbd>: clears the
  toggles for the selected level.

#### Other ways to toggle the hints on and off

- Using the keyboard shortcut <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd>
- Clicking on the Rango icon in the toolbar.

### Opening Rango Related Pages

- The command <kbd>rango open {page}</kbd> opens a Rango related page in a new
  tab. The pages are: sponsor, readme, issues, new issue and changelog.

### More on Hints

#### Using Number for Hints

If you prefer to use numbers instead of letters for hints there are two steps
you need to take:

- Enable the setting `Use number for hints` in the extension.
- Add the tag `user.rango_number_hints` in _rango.talon_ within _rango-talon_ in
  your Talon user folder.

One thing to consider is that Rango draws hints outside of the viewport for a
better scrolling experience. When using number hints this might often result in
three digit numbers being used. These high numbers might be longer to pronounce.
If you want to minimize this you can modify the margin around the viewport where
Rango draws hints. For that you can use the setting `Viewport margin`. A value
of 0 will make that only the elements within the viewport receive hints.

#### Which Elements Receive Hints

By default, only certain elements receive hints. If the element is clickable it
should receive a hint. Most of the time it does, but in some rare cases, it
might not. In order for an element to receive a hint it must be minimally
accessible. This means that it must use the right semantic element or indicate
what its role is. For example, the following buttons would display a hint.

`<button>Click me!</button>`

`<div role="button">Click me!</div>`

But there won't be a hint for the following element:

`<div class="btn">Click me!</div>`

In earlier versions of the extension I would try to display more hints by
default by looking at things like the element's class name, the onclick property
or the css property `cursor: pointer`. The issue with this approach is we would
get many duplicate hints and some unnecessary ones. Reducing those duplicates
and unnecessary hints wasn't always possible and resulted in complicated and
poorly performant code.

#### Displaying Extra Hints

Moving away from that complicated logic resulted in better performance and
cleaner ui. But now we need a way to display hints for those elements that are
not accessible. For that we use the command <kbd>hint extra</kbd>. At this point
we don't care so much about duplicates and we can use all those extra checks to
see if an element might be clickable. The command <kbd>hint less</kbd> lets us
go back to only displaying the default hints.

#### Custom Hints

With the command <kbd>hint extra</kbd> now we have a way to show hints for those
elements that don't receive them by default. But you might frequently use some
page where some elements that you want to click don't receive hints. Having to
use the command <kbd>hint extra</kbd> every time you want to click one of those
elements can become tedious. Custom hints are a way to indicate that you want
some extra hints to always display by default.

After having used the command <kbd>hint extra</kbd> you can use the command
<kbd>include &lt;target&gt;</kbd> to indicate that you want some hints to always
display. The hints selected for inclusion will be marked in green. The best
approach is to use at least a couple of hints representing the same ui element.
With those hints Rango calculates the css selector that includes both. It tries
not to be greedy and use the selector that includes the least amount of hints
possible. This is usually enough to include the desired ui element. In case it
falls short and doesn't include all the elements you want, you can use the
command <kbd>some more</kbd>. This will pick a different selector that matches
more elements (not necessarily the same elements matched before). The command
<kbd>some less</kbd> does the opposite. You can use the <kbd>include</kbd>
command again if you need to add more hints representing different ui elements.
Once you are happy with the result you can use the command <kbd>custom hints
save</kbd> so that those hints appear by default the next time.

If you want to exclude all the hints to later add only the ones you're
interested in you can use the command <kbd>exclude all</kbd>. You will need to
save after using this command and before including only those hints you want.

Here is one example to illustrate this process:

In [this page](https://forvo.com/word/define/#en) we have this section which
unfortunately doesn't show any hints.

<p align="left">
  <img src="images/screenshot-custom-hints-1.png" alt="">
</p>

Now we use the command <kbd>hint extra</kbd> to greedily display hints.

<p align="left">
  <img src="images/screenshot-custom-hints-2.png" alt="">
</p>

If we wanted to show hints for the gray links we can issue the command
<kbd>include cap each and cap drum</kbd>, which marks in green the hints that
will be included.

<p align="left">
  <img src="images/screenshot-custom-hints-3.png" alt="">
</p>

Since the result is not exactly what we want and there are still hints missing
we use the command <kbd>some more</kbd>.

<p align="left">
  <img src="images/screenshot-custom-hints-4.png" alt="">
</p>

Now there are more hints showing but they're not the ones we want. We issue the
command <kbd>some more</kbd> again to see if that helps.

<p align="left">
  <img src="images/screenshot-custom-hints-5.png" alt="">
</p>

The hints marked for inclusion now are exactly the ones we want. We could
continue including more custom hints using the <kbd>include</kbd> command again
but for the moment we leave it like that and save with <kbd>custom hints
save</kbd>.

<p align="left">
  <img src="images/screenshot-custom-hints-6.png" alt="">
</p>

Now the extra hints disappear and we are left with the custom hints that we just
defined. We can see that similar elements also display hints. Next time we visit
the page those hints will be displayed by default.

This same process can be used to exclude hints using the command <kbd>exclude
&lt;target&gt;</kbd>. With the command <kbd>hint more</kbd> we can display any
previously excluded hints.

If after using the <kbd>include</kbd> or <kbd>exclude</kbd> command you are not
happy with the hints marked for inclusion/exclusion you can use the command
<kbd>some less</kbd> (you might have to use it a few times if you've already
used the command <kbd>some more</kbd>) to remove the recently marked hints and
start over. This will keep any hints marked with a previous <kbd>include</kbd>
or <kbd>exclude</kbd> command.

Here is a summary of all the commands for customizing hints:

- <kbd>hint extra</kbd>: Display hints for more elements.
- <kbd>hint more</kbd>: Display hints for previously excluded elements.
- <kbd>hint less</kbd>: Only display the default hints.
- <kbd>include &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Mark the selected hints for inclusion.
- <kbd>exclude &lt;target&gt;</kbd>: Mark the selected hints for exclusion.
- <kbd>exclude all</kbd>: Mark all the hints for exclusion. Uses the css
  universal selector `*`.
- <kbd>some more</kbd>: Mark more hints for inclusion/exclusion.
- <kbd>some less</kbd>: Mark less hints for inclusion/exclusion.
- <kbd>custom hints save</kbd>: Save the currently selected hints marked for
  inclusion/exclusion so that they render by default.
- <kbd>custom hints reset</kbd>: Remove any previously included/excluded custom
  hints.

Custom hints can also be edited, added or removed from the settings page.

#### Hiding a Particular Hint

On occasions a hint might be obscured by another hint that is stacked on top of
the first one. For those occasions you can use the command <kbd>hide
&lt;target&gt;</kbd> to hide the hint on top.

## Known Issues and Limitations

There is currently no way to open a pure CSS dropdown menu like the "hover" menu
in
[this example](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/components/megamenu-demo.php#).
It is not possible to activate the `:hover` pseudo class in javascript and this
will only be possible once I implement cursor moving/clicking.

### No Hints or Other Missing Functionality in Certain Pages

Content scripts (the part of the extension that runs in the context of webpages)
aren't able to run in browser's internal pages. These pages start with
`chrome://`, `edge://`, `about:` or similar and provide information and control
over browsers internal state, including settings, flags, and debugging
information. Allowing content scripts on these pages could enable malicious
extensions to change settings or access sensitive data without the user's
knowledge. For this reason hints an other functionality won't be available in
these pages.

Similarly, there are other domains where content scripts are not allowed to run.

These are restricted Chromium domains:

```text
clients.google.com
clients[0-9]+.google.com
sb-ssl.google.com
chrome.google.com/webstore/*
```

These are restricted Firefox domains:

```text
accounts-static.cdn.mozilla.net
accounts.firefox.com
addons.cdn.mozilla.net
addons.mozilla.org
api.accounts.firefox.com
content.cdn.mozilla.net
discovery.addons.mozilla.org
install.mozilla.org
oauth.accounts.firefox.com
profile.accounts.firefox.com
support.mozilla.org
sync.services.mozilla.com
```

To allow WebExtensions in Firefox to run on these pages (at your own risk), open
`about:config` and modify the following[^3]:

- Set `extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains` to be an empty string.
- Set `privacy.resistFingerprinting.block_mozAddonManager` to true.

Another alternative is to use a Chromium browser to access Firefox restricted
domains and Firefox to access Chromium restricted domains.
